# Articulations

Application made for the Articulation research project - a multiplayer experience where two and more dancers can immerse themselves
and see each other as a set of spheres or other minimalistic representation.
The software can be launched as a server, that handles the registration of every player, can change their representation, and
write on CSV files the performances as a set of positions and rotations for each body part.
The client can be either a player or a viewer, the player searches automatically for a Vive System to work with, the viewer can be
an invisible watcher that can control a camera around the scene to observe the performance.

To launch the project :
- Start first the server (a choice is made at the launch of the application)
- Then add a client, player or viewer, by giving the right IP address into the Ip Field (can be automatically written in the 
GameData file in the streamingAssets folder linked to the project)
